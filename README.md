<h4 align="center">a low-latency partial reconfiguration controller</h4>

# Introduction
- Dora, a low-latency FPGA partial reconfiguration controller, is proposed in this letter to address the latency challenge faced by traditional solutions in highly real-time reconfigurable systems.
- Based on the producer-consumer model, a streaming transmission mechanism and an adaptive ICAP overclocking clock training algorithm are proposed and integrated into Dora, aiming to achieve efficient production and consumption of configuration bitstreams.

# Performance
Experiments show that Dora reduces FPGA resource utilization by over 60%, achieves a high reconfiguration rate, and slashes latency to 11.1 msâ€”merely 2.6% of the standard Xilinx solution. This remarkable performance positions Dora as a superior choice for a wide range of scenarios and domains.


# How to use

## For secondary development
All the modules in Dora are self-developed, and it is only necessary to integrate their verilog implementation (/rtl) into the project source code.

## Just for test
We provide an example (/example/vc709) on VC709 Board where users can test our Dora by switching between different lighting applications.
1. Configure the demo.bit
2. Install the xdma driver
3. Transfer rm0.bin or rm1.bin using driver
